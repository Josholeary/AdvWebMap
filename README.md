- Final step of deployment (Nginx fail):

I set up my domain name on Namecheap and a Digital Ocean droplet with all docker containers installed and running besides Nginx which caused an issue with deployment. I tried to resolve this issue but the port was occupied and the articles revolving around this issue did not have a resolution.
